# Trading Pairs
1. Understand the role of correlation in selecting pairs within an industry sector
2. Create a hierarchical clustering using a daily return matric
3. Construct a scree plot using principal component

## Use Correlation to select pairs

Measuring Correlation

## Identify Hierarchical clusters of stocks and create a cluster plot
How? -- Clustering analysis

Hierarchical Clustering Matrix
    
    Use matrix containing daily returns for each stock in OLK
    1. Columns contain data for a particular stock
    2. Rows contain data for a particular trading day

    Computing disance between returns
    1. Calculate using Euclidean method
    2. Iteractively cluster stocks based on minimizing distance
